# Introduction

Cofeescript is an improved version of Javascript. This module allows to use Coffeescript in your modules, and include Coffeescript files in your Drupal pages. This uses a PHP interpreter to compile the CoffeeScript into javascript.

# Usage

coffeescript_add_cs($data,$type)

If $type is 'file', then data is the coffeescript file. If $type is 'inline', it will compile the iniline code.

# About Coffeescript

The CoffeeScript syntax aims to simplify Javascript. See http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/. For example

	var a=3;

becomes
	a = 3

You can write functions as (x)->x instead of function(x) { return(x); }
